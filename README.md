This GitHub repository is an ongoing project that aims to provide a collection 
of retyped, retranslated, and annotated books sourced from low-quality 
PDFs and EPUBs.  **This is, to be honest, a personal project.**  Thus, 
translations, formatting, and word choices will be highly opinionated.

## Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Retyping**:  Convert books from low-quality PDFs and EPUBs into clean and 
easily readable text.  This process involves manually transcribing the content 
to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Retranslation**:  Improve the quality of translations when necessary.  If a 
book has an inadequate or outdated translation **(based mostly on personal opinion)**, 
efforts will be made to retranslate it and enhance the overall readability 
and comprehension of the text.

3. **Annotation**:  Enhance the books with annotations and additional contextual 
information, where applicable.  This includes providing footnotes, references, 
and clarifications to improve the reader's understanding of the content.

4. **Formatting**:  Improve the overall aesthetic and readability of the books 
by addressing formatting issues present in the original sources.  This involves 
optimizing typography, layout, and styling to create visually appealing and 
user-friendly reading experiences.

## Current Status

This project has just started and is currently in progress.  I will be
contributing here on my free time, which will affect the speed of completion.
Each book is stored in its own directory in the form of source files and
will have to be compiled.  I am considering releasing pre-compiled copies once
books are finished.
