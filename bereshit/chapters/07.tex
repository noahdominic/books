Yahweh then said to Noah, 
`Go into the ark with your household,
for you alone I have found righteous
in this generation. 
Take with you seven pairs,
male and its mate,
of every clean animal, 
and take with you one pair,
male and its mate,
of every unclean animal.
Take also with you seven pairs,
male and its mate,
of all the birds in the sky.
This will keep seed alive upon all the earth.
In seven days' time,
I will send rain upon the earth. 
It will rain forty days and forty nights,
and I will erase from the face of the ground
every living thing that I have made.
